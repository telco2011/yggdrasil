Create applications easy to scale and full-featured.

Yggdrasil architecture makes easy to create javascript backend applications. Using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) features, it makes easy to scale and maintain them as well.

## Prerequisites

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (_Yggdrasil recommends to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)_)
* Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (_Yggdrasil recommends to use yarn to build its applications_)

## Getting Started

To start to use yggdrasil architecture, you could use the starter project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yggdrasilts/yggdrasil-starter.git [PROJECT_NAME]
cd [PROJECT_NAME]
yarn install
yarn start
```

The default access is in **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

## Built With

Yggdrasil uses the following frameworks/tools to be developed.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - A JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/).
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A superset of JavaScript.
* [Expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - Fast, reliable and secure dependency management.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - The package manager for JavaScript and the world‚Äôs largest software registry.
* [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) - A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.
* [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) - An extensible linter for the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language.
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun
* [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) - JavaScript test coverage made simple.
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - Gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.
